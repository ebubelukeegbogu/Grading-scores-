Algorithm: Grading system 

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input score
Step 3:
  If score >= 70 and score <= 100 then
    grade ← 'A'
  Else if score >= 60 and score <= 69 then
    grade ← 'B'
  Else if score >= 50 and score <= 59 then
    grade ← 'C'
  Else if score >= 45 and score <= 49 then
    grade ← 'D'
  Else if score >= 40 and score <= 44 then
    grade ← 'E'
  Else if score >= 0 and score <= 39 then
    grade ← 'F'
  Else
    grade ← 'Invalid score'
Step 4: Output grade
Step 5: End
